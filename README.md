# Ai-summarization for documents,pdf,image

Project Title: "DocuSense – AI-Powered Smart Document Assistant"

We build a web-based platform that automatically organizes, classifies, and extracts key information from uploaded documents using AI. The tool can support various document types (PDFs, images, Word files) and help users search and interact with them intelligently.

Core Features:
Multi-format Upload – Accept documents in PDF, Word, or image format.

# AI-Powered Classification – Auto-tagging (e.g., invoice, resume, report).

 # OCR + NLP – Extract and structure data like names, dates, amounts, etc.

Semantic Search Engine – Find documents by meaning, not just keywords.

# Smart Summary Generator – AI-generated short summaries of documents.

Role-Based Access Control – Secure sharing with permissions.

Timeline & Audit Log – Track who accessed or modified a document.

Tech Stack Suggestion:
# Frontend: React or Next.js

 # Backend: Node.js / Python (FastAPI or Flask)

OCR: Tesseract or Google Vision API

# NLP: OpenAI API, spaCy, or HuggingFace Transformers

Storage: Firebase / AWS S3 / MongoDB

Search: Elasticsearch for semantic search

Authentication: Firebase Auth / Auth0

Bonus Features (if time allows):
Integrate with Gmail/Drive/Dropbox to auto-fetch documents.

Export structured data to Excel/CSV.

Chatbot interface to query documents conversationally
